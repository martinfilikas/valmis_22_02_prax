<p>5. If your guess was not right, the program will show you a message “Sorry, your guess ... did not match with AI. Please try again.”</p>
<p>6. If you guessed right with first time, you will earn 3 points, if you guessed right with second time, you get 2 points
    and if you guessed right with third time you will get 1 point. Then after third try you will get less than 1 point.
    Overall you can try 50 times to guess the right answer, after that you will get a message : “Sorry, you have tried too
    many times, right answer was number ... “. After a third try, you will have 47 more tries left. The formula works like this:
    Imagine you are trying the fourth time and then you will get 1/(50-4) points.</p>
